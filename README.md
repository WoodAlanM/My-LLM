# LLM-mar (Large Language Model - Made Accessible Remotely)

LLM-mar is a mobile application for Android designed to help make it easier to connect to a self-hosted LLM. It is intended to be used with a secure tunneling service to allow for direct access to an LLM running on a user's own hardware.

## Usage

1. You need to have an LLM exposed to your network. Depending on the tunneling service you are using, this may be enough to make the connection.

2. Open the settings page in LLM-mar by clicking the hamburger button in the top right corner. This will open the settings modal.

-   Change the LLM IP to the remotely accessible IP of your self-hosted LLM.
-   Change the model name to match the model you are running.

3. The main screen should show a server status. If the server is online, you can send your prompts as you would if you were interacting with your LLM in at your desktop.

## Settings

The following settings are available beyond LLM IP, and Model Name.

- Verbose: The Verbose setting works with some LLM's. It is meant to reduce the output.

- Dark Mode: This changes the UI to dark mode. It is likely that you know about dark mode if you are here.
